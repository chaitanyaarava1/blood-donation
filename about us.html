    <h2 class="about"><em><b>How much blood can be taken?</b></em></h2>
    <p class="about"><em><b>Our body has 5.5 ltr of blood of which only 350 ml - 450 ml of blood is 
        taken depending upon weight of donor.<br> Majority of healthy adults can tolerate
        withdrawal of one unit of blood. The withdrawn blood volume is restored 
        within 24 hours and the hemoglobin and cell components are restored in 2 months.<br>
        Therefore it is safe to donate blood every three months.
        </b></em></p>
        <h2 class="about"><em><b>What is done with the blood collected?</b></em></h2>
        <p class="about"><em><b>The blood collected in sterile, pyrogen free containers with anticoagulants 
            like CPDA or CPDA with SAGM. This prevents clotting and provides nutrition for the cells. 
            This blood is stored at 2-6 C or -20 C depending on the component prepared. Donated blood 
            undergoes various tests like blood grouping antibody detection, testing of infections 
            like hepatitis, AIDS, Malaria, syphilis and before it reaches the recipient it undergoes 
            compatibility testing with the recipient blood.

            <h2 class="about"><em><b>Modern Blood Transfusion Practice:</b></em></h2>
            <p class="about"><em><b>Modern blood transfusion basically deals with the optimal use of one unit of blood. 
                One unit of whole blood is separated into components making it available to different 
                patients according to their requirement. Thus one unit of blood is converted into packed cell 
                volume, fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrate, cryoprecipitate and granulocytes concentrate. 
                Another important practice is apheresis. This is separation of only desired component from 
                the donor and return the remaining constituent back to donor. This technique is also 
                used for remaining pathological substance in patients. Withdrawal of blood for transfusion
                is regarded as a safe procedure now and blood donor has emerged as the single most vital link.
