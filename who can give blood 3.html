        <li><em><strong>Most people can give blood if they are in good health.There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor. Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:</strong></em></li>
        <h2><em><strong><u>Age</u></strong></em></h2>
        <li><em><strong>Age should be from 18-60 years</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.</strong></em></li>
        <h2><em><strong><u>Health</u></strong></em></h2>
        <li><em><strong>You must be in good health at the time you donate.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation</strong></em></li>

        <h2><em><strong><u>Before blood Donation</u></strong></em></h2>
        <li><em><strong>Make sure your Hb in within normal range.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>Eat iron-rich diet like beans, spinach, fish, red meat and iron-fortified cereals.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>Have a sound sleep and drink lots of fluids.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>No alcohol should be consumed before the donation day.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>Stop taking blood thinning medication before 2-3 days, if any.</strong></em></li>
        
        <h2><em><strong><u>Weight</u></strong></em></h2>
        <li><em><strong>You weigh at least 50 kg.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>donors of whole blood donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10%.</strong></em></li>
        
        <h2><em><strong><u>Travel</u></strong></em></h2>
        <li><em><strong>Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria,may result in a temporary deferral.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.</strong></em></li>

        <h2><em><strong><u>Pregnancy and breastfeeding</u></strong></em></h2>
        <li><em><strong>Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em><strong>It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).</strong></em></li>

    </ul>
